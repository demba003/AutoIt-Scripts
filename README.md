# AutoIt Scripts
In this repo I have some old AutoIt scripts I used

### vmf2map.au3 
is a tool to convert .vmf file used in some extension for Sketchup (exporting model as map for Counter Strike Source) to .map format used in Counter Strike 1.6.
I wrote it to make creating maps easier for me.
This script transfers only walls with their textures, so special objects have to be added by hand.
