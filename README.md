# AutoIt Scripts
In this repo I have some old AutoIt scripts I used

### vmf2map.au3 
is a tool to convert .vmf file used in some extension for Sketchup (exporting model as map for Counter Strike Source) to .map format used in Counter Strike 1.6.
I wrote it to make creating maps easier for me.
This script transfers only walls with their textures, so special objects have to be added by hand.

### SubwayKeyboard.au3
PC version of Subway Surfers game required to make swipe gestures using mouse (some kind of touchscreen emulation). This simple script makes proper gestures after pressing specified buttons so it's more comfortable to play.

Left/Rigth arrows - changing track

Up/Down arrows - jump/roll

Spacebar - use board

Escape - pause game
